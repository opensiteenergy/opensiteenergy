*** Build failure likely due to lack of memory ***
If running local install, increase swap disk size to > 10Gb
If running Docker install, increase Docker swap size by editing Docker config file:
1. Edit Docker config file - for locations see https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings-and-maintenance/settings/
2. Modify 'SwapMiB' and set to 10000
3. Fully quit and restart Docker for new 'SwapMiB' setting to take effect
4. Rerun ./build-docker.sh
